<p><h2>Chase,</h2></p>
<p>
<h2>I'll always care about you. I do mean that, even when it might not seem like it. Regardless of the choices you or I make, regardless of our current opinion of each other, I will always care. I'm not sure where we're going to be years from now or if we'll even talk to each other after college. You greatly impacted my life; I learned a lot and ultimately had a great time getting to know you, your friends, and your family. Part of me will always care about you a little more than the other people in my life. I hope you'll take advantage of that if you're ever in a tough spot and need someone to turn to. Regardless of the situation, you can always look at this page and know you matter to someone. <3</h2>

<p><h2>Love ya dude,<br />Nick</h2></p>
